RESTful URLs with Spring MVC and UrlRewriteFilter by Carl Sziebert (http://sziebert.net/posts/restful-urls-with-spring-mvc-and-urlrewritefilter/)

-----

This sample application utilizes Spring 2.5.6 and UrlRewriteFilter 3.1.0.  It demonstrates a simple UrlRewriteFilter configuration which rewrites RESTful URLs back to Spring MVC controllers.  In order to run the application you will need to have Ant (http://ant.apache.org) and Tomcat (http://tomcat.apache.org) installed.  To get started run the default ant command (ant or ant compile) and deploy the application to Tomcat.
