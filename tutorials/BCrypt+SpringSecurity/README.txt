Using Bcrypt with Spring Security by Carl Sziebert (http://sziebert.net/posts/)

-----

This sample application utilizes Spring 2.5.6 and jBCrypt 0.2. It demonstrates a simple PasswordEncoder implementation that showcases BCrypt's easy-to-use API and is used to authenticate users in a Spring MVC / Spring Security application. In order to run the application you will need to have Ant (http://ant.apache.org) and Tomcat (http://tomcat.apache.org) installed.  To get started run the default ant command (ant or ant compile) and deploy the application to Tomcat.
