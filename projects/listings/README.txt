Profile based site with tweet like teaser notes. Accounts tier across features with high end getting unlimited teasers and a featured image on the home page and in the directory. Use hibernate envers to build a history of changes across profiles and a moderation tool. Includes most all changes to a given profile, title, display name, images, etc. Primary feature should be to search for profiles in a specific area, discovered by geo/ip or entered by a user as a zip code. Add reviews and other features after the core profile and search functionality is in place. Do simple analytics for teasers to profile views as well as overall views. Use tags to build a correlation between interests and options. Build glossary of terms based upon tags. Allow users to add definitions to a given tag. Could show tags primary/popular definitions in a tooltip. Could eventually charge a 1 time membership fee like pinboard (0.01 * # of members or profiles). Should show the list of recently viewed ads on the join page as a way to encourage sign ups.

Potential tag line: "Hyper-local hook-ups"

Original Notes
--
Five + Five type account with additional fee for each ad. So we would charge everyone a flat rate of $4.95 per month and then an additional $4.95 per ad posting. Could also offer some sort of "sticky" ad with a flat fee of $100 per month.
